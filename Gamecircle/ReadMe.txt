This sample project exhibits basic leaderboard and achievement functionality in Amazon GameCircle.

GameCircle testing requires generating an api key for GameCircle on the GameCircle configuration Dashboard at https://developer.amazon.com/gc/cfg/index.html?.

Once you have generated a key, put it in a file called api_key.txt in the root of this project.

Create an achievement, a leaderboard and assign your Amazon GameCircle account as a test account.
